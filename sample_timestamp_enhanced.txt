=== LEGAL NOTICE ===
This timestamp is verified against authoritative time servers
and provides cryptographic proof that this video existed
at the specified time and location. The SHA-256 hash ensures file integrity.
Any modification to the video will change the hash completely.

=== VERIFICATION STEPS ===
1. Calculate SHA-256 hash of video file and compare with above hash
2. Verify file size matches the recorded size
3. Visit Google Maps link to verify exact recording location
4. Check Plus Code for additional location verification
5. Contact worldtimeapi.org for timestamp verification
6. Check that timestamps are consistent across systems
7. Verify location accuracy is reasonable for the situation
8. Check location age to ensure GPS reading was recent

=== INTEGRITY GUARANTEE ===
Any alteration to the video file will result in a completely different
SHA-256 hash, making tampering immediately detectable.
